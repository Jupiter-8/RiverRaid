# RiverRaid

## Description

This project is a simple clone of the game "River Raid" released in 1982 for the Atari 2600 video game console.
It was developed as the final project for study subject "Cross-platform application programming".

Used framework: QT 5.15.2 C++

## How to run

You can easily build and run it using QT Creator IDE, I recommend minimum version: 5.15.2, so the same that I was using during the development.
